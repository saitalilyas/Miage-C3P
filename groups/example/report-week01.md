#### Collections :

  - A collection is a list of objects, it used to groups some objects "in the same variable".
  - Pharo standard library provide iterative collections (i'm not sure about this name)
  - We can iterate with commands do: if we want to show the data, select: if we want to filter it or even collect: for do operations on it.

  Here are some examples that I tried :

  #(45 56 76 34) select: [ :each | each odd ].
  
  #(45 56 76 34) collect: [ :each | each * 5 ].
