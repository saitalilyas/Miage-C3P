In Pharo, conditionals (if, else, while) are messages sent to boolean or block objects true or false. 
In most programming languages conditionals use keywords like if, else, elif.
Pharo makes conditionals simple because everything is just a message sent. For me, a drawback is that it’s new, so it may take me some time to understand it properly.
I found this by checking these documents : https://rmod-pharo-mooc.lille.inria.fr/OOPMooc/01-Welcome/W1S07-BasicBooleansAndCondition.pdf

Exemple:

| peterIsSick action |

peterIsSick := true.  

action := peterIsSick
    ifTrue: [ 'Give Aspirine' ]
    ifFalse: [ 'Ask To Take A Bath' ].

Transcript show: action; cr.


Coding Style

In Pharo, writing tests follows a set of conventions that make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

Package names
It is best practice to keep test code separate from production code. Tests should be placed in their own package, named after the original package with the suffix -Tests.

Class names
All test classes in Pharo are subclasses of TestCase. Their names should end with the suffix Test (not Tests, since each class represents a single test case).
 For unit tests, the convention is MyClassTest.

Method names
Test methods must start with the prefix test. This is how the testing framework identifies them as tests.
 When writing a unit test for a specific method, the test name should combine the prefix test with the name of the method under test.

Are there tools that show you violations too ? 
Playground⁠ : helps you spot mistakes immediately because you can run code snippets line by line. https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki/blob/master/General/Playground.md


Inspector : helps you see whether your code is behaving as expected or if something is wrong. https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki/blob/master/General/Inspector.md

⁠Quality Assistant : It analyzes your methods and warns you about style or design rule violations. (The idea behind Quality Assistant is to have a bot that assists you with the quality of your code.) https://github.com/Uko/QualityAssistant?tab=readme-ov-file#in-inspector


Rules :  is a small model of rules that a model should not violate. It is able to compute the technical debt for a set of violations. https://github.com/jecisc/Rules
