# Challenges

This list presents challenges. There are either in Microdown/Foliage or in Bloc. 
Each group will have to take one or two challenges and work on it. 

- Microdown is a markdown language and its set of tools (generator for HTML/LaTeX) and others.
It is used by Pillar (the compilation chain) and Foliage (a static web generation system)
- Games in Bloc. Myg is a group of games developed on Bloc

For each challenge you will have to 
- present the existing design and situation
