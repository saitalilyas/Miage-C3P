## Project

I created my own piece colors so that I could remove the last remaining condition in the render...: aPiece methods of the MyBlackChessSquare and MyWhiteChessSquare classes.  
I've modified my tests to keep them green with this new implementation.  
For the moment, I've left the color variable in the MyPiece class because it was used to compare the color of the pieces with the color of the player.
