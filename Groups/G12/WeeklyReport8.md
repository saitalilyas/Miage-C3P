# Maureen's section

## Prepare
I read again the slides about composite and visitor patterns. I also watched the videos.

## Project
I worked on a new modelisation of my kata with Elsa and Thomas. We find out a solution that reduces yhe number of conditionals and duplicated code. I start to try to implement it.
The problem now is to do coexist my Kata and Julien's kata, because I had to do two class BlackPawn and WhitePawn who inherits from MyPawn, but Julien seems to make the color independant of the piece.

## Project

To finalize my kata, I removed the color variable from the Mypiece and MyPlayer classes and used my own color classes, which I'd had to create beforehand.  
I modified the methods that used this variable so that they would still work.
