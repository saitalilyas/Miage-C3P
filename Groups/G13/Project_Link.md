This is the link to my repository chess project : https://github.com/ikramleilahm/Chess/tree/pawn 

This link contains my kata in its original form (just MyPawn class), i tried also to make a refactoring to my kata after the merge with sepideh by implementing all pawn moves with the hierrarchie MyPawn/ MyblackPawn and MywhitePawn but the last move does not work (enPassant) that's why i returned to my initial kata and i continued implementing the enPassant move. But this is the link of the branch where i did some refactoring : https://github.com/ikramleilahm/Chess/tree/readytomerge
