# Rapport Pharo - Semaine 6

## André FILHO

For this week, our task was to dive into the Pharo Visitor pattern, focusing on understanding its structure and exploring its potential applications within our project.

I started by examining the concept of the Visitor pattern within the Pharo environment, focusing specifically on its use cases in Pillar. This included analyzing documentation and analysing the MOOC, in which I found some insight comparing the pattern to Double Dispatch.

Attempted Application in Project Context
Eventhough I thoroughly studied the theoretical aspects and reviewed practical examples, I encountered challenges in identifying a relevant use case for applying the Visitor pattern directly within our chess project, especially to my Kata.

Observations and Next Steps

This exploration allowed me to grasp the fundamental mechanics of the Visitor pattern in Pharo, including the advantages it offers in terms of extending functionalities without modifying original classes By contrast, I believe I still miss on some hands-on approach to better understand how it works, which I plan to do whils resolving the exercises next class.
